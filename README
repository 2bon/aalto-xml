Aalto XML processor is an ultra-high performance next generation Stax XML processor implementation. It also implements SAX2 API.

Aalto is not directly related to other existing implementations such as Woodstox or Sun Java Streaming XML Parser, although it did come about as a prototype for evaluating implementation strategies that differ from those traditionally used for Java-based parsers. 

Two major design goals for Aalto are:

* Ultra-high performance parsing by making the Common Case Fast (similar to original RISC manifesto). This may mean limiting functionality, but never compromising correctness. XML 1.0 compliancy is not sacrificed for speed.
* Allowing non-block, asynchronous parsing: it should be possible to "feed" more input and incrementally get more XML events out, without forcing the current thread to block on I/O read operation.
